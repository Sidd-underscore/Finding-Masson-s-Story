					“Finally!” I had thought. “A relaxing ocean vacation!” Oh, I was so wrong. Since you’ve found this,
					I’m glad I can warn someone not to wander where I did, but, sadly, I can’t send all the records of
					my disastrous adventures in this tiny Coca Cola can. I do, however, have instructions for you, if
					you are brave enough to venture in the infernal land I had the misfortune of vacationing on to find
					out exactly why I am missing. I have split my story into three sagas, to not only complicate your
					life but to also provide you with first-hand accounts of what is written in what you aim to dig up.
					Ready to start? Firstly, take a boat to the island found at the coordinates 48.1364° N, 53.6129° W.
					A pier is located in the South-West corner of the island.

					<uhoh>I’m getting tired...</uhoh><br>
					Stand at the end of the pier. The desired object is anywhere within 6 paces of your location. To
					pinpoint its exact location, you will be glad to know that it is also anywhere within 4 paces of the
					Bottomless Pit.

				<p>
					<uhoh>The fatigue is setting in...</uhoh><br>
					Stroll up to The Beach. Look down at The Mountains, admire them, but most importantly use your
					sextant to draw a line that stretches as far as possible 55° to the left of The Mountains using the
					pails of water by the umbrella. Then, walk down in a straight direction towards The Mountains but
					stop once you’ve walked five paces. Chapter 2 will be within 4.5 paces from you.

				<p>
					<uhoh>Oh goodness the tiredness is overwhelming...</uhoh><br>
					Hike to the forest. Orient yourself so you’re looking directly at The Tree and use your handy-dandy
					sextant and measure 40° to the left of The Tree. Then, go to The Tree and orient yourself so you’re
					staring straight where you just were. Measure 50° to the left of that location. Using that
					information, you will find the last part of my saga.
